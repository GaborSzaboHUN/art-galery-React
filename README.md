## Art Gallery React

My goal was to create a page summarizing selected exhibitions of a fictional gallery. I fetched the data from the public API of the MET museum.

### How to open the project:
- in VScode open the terminal
- open "ask-nasa-javascript-GaborSzaboHUN" folder if you somewhere else
- <code>npm install express</code> to install Express.JS
- <code>node backend/server.js</code> to start the server
- <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000</code> you can find the project on that IP address
